## 👋 Introduction

Hi, I’m Sabuj — a Developer Relations and Developer Experience professional with 10+ years of
experience working on APIs, SDKs, integrations, and developer platforms.

I focus on reducing developer friction by designing documentation, tutorials, workflows,
and developer-facing tools that help teams move from exploration to successful integration
faster. My work sits at the intersection of Engineering, Product, Documentation, and
Developer Communities.

---

## 🧠 My DX Perspective

I approach developer experience as a **journey problem**, not a documentation problem.

When working on developer-facing products, I focus on:

- Time-to-first-success and safe experimentation
- API clarity, predictability, and recoverability
- End-to-end workflows over isolated endpoints
- Practical examples, edge cases, and failure modes
- Systems that scale across humans, SDKs, and AI tools

I regularly review APIs, SDKs, and docs from a developer’s point of view and provide feedback
on naming, payloads, error handling, and overall usability.

## 📊 Data-Informed Developer Experience  *(new section)*

I use data to validate DX assumptions and understand how developers actually interact with
documentation, APIs, and tooling.

Rather than relying on page views alone, I look for **experience signals** across the
developer journey.

**How I apply data to DX:**

- Use tools like **GA4 and Pendo** to understand discovery paths, engagement patterns,
  and drop-offs across API docs, SDK docs, and tutorials
- Analyze **session-level behavior with FullStory** to identify confusion points,
  navigation friction, and mismatches between documentation flow and developer intent
- Use **Looker Studio** to visualize DX trends and patterns, helping teams reason about
  onboarding effectiveness, content clarity, and workflow adoption

The goal is not reporting for its own sake, but using data to continuously improve
developer journeys and reduce integration friction.

## ✍️ DX Writing & Thought Leadership

I write about developer experience, docs-as-code, and building scalable documentation systems
that support both humans and AI-driven tools.

## 🧪 Developer Tooling & DX (Chargebee)

At Chargebee, I contributed to developer-facing tools designed to reduce onboarding friction
and improve API discoverability.

### API Explorer

The Chargebee API Explorer allows developers to explore and test APIs in a real-time,
pre-authenticated environment without writing code.

**DX value:**
- Faster exploration and learning
- Clear visibility into requests and responses
- Reduced setup overhead during onboarding

**My role:**
- Shaped guided prompts around real integration workflows
- Ensured prompts aligned with valid parameters, edge cases, and API behavior
- Partnered with Engineering and Product to improve API usability through guided interactions

### Chargebee Copilot (AI-Assisted Developer Tool)

Chargebee Copilot is an AI-powered assistant that helps developers understand APIs, troubleshoot
integration issues, and get contextual guidance.

**DX value:**
- Natural-language access to API knowledge
- Context-aware guidance during onboarding and debugging
- Improved self-service success for developers

**My role:**
- Helped define prompts and scenarios based on real developer questions
- Ensured responses were accurate, contextual, and consistent with API behavior
- Contributed to common onboarding, error-handling, and integration workflows

## 🧩 Real-World Developer Enablement

### SDK Documentation

- **iOS SDK**  
  Improved README structure, onboarding clarity, and usage examples.  
  https://github.com/chargebee/chargebee-ios/blob/master/README.md

- **Android SDK**  
  Ensured consistency between SDK abstractions and underlying API behavior.

---

## 🎥 Visual & Interactive Developer Content  *(new section)*

I use visual and interactive formats to reduce cognitive load and help developers
understand complex systems faster.

- Create **workflow and system diagrams using Mermaid** to explain API flows,
  integrations, and developer journeys
- Use **Camtasia and Trainn** to create short, task-focused videos that complement
  written documentation and support onboarding
- Collaborate with Product and Design teams using **Figma** to align documentation
  layouts and components with product UX

My goal with visuals is always the same:  
**make the next developer action obvious and low-friction.**

---

## 💻 Code & Tooling

I work hands-on with the tools developers actually use:

- HTML, CSS, JavaScript (ES6+)
- TypeScript (working knowledge)
- JSON and XML
- Markdown and MDX
- GitHub workflows and CI/CD
- API tooling (Postman, curl)

I also work with analytics, visualization, and media tools to support
data-informed and visually guided developer experiences.
