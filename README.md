## 👋 Introduction

Hi, I’m Sabuj — a Developer Relations and Developer Experience professional with 10+ years of
experience working on APIs, SDKs, integrations, and developer platforms.

I specialize in reducing developer friction by designing clear documentation, tutorials,
interactive tools, and AI-assisted experiences that help developers succeed faster.
My work sits at the intersection of Engineering, Product, Documentation, and Developer Communities.

---

## 🧠 How I Approach Developer Experience

When working on developer-facing products, I focus on:

- Time-to-first-success for developers
- API clarity, predictability, and usability
- Real-world workflows over theoretical documentation
- Practical examples, edge cases, and failure modes
- Documentation and tools that scale across humans, SDKs, and AI systems

I regularly review APIs from a developer’s point of view and provide feedback on naming,
payloads, error handling, and overall usability.

## 🧪 Developer Tooling & DX (Chargebee)

At :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}, I worked on multiple developer-facing tools
designed to reduce onboarding friction and improve API discoverability.

### API Explorer

The Chargebee API Explorer is a real-time, pre-authenticated environment that allows developers
to explore and test APIs without writing code.

**What it enables:**
- Interactive exploration of APIs
- Real-time request/response visibility
- Faster experimentation and learning
- Reduced setup and boilerplate effort

**My contribution:**
- Designed and refined prompts that guide developers through common API workflows
- Ensured prompt accuracy with valid parameters, edge cases, and real API behavior
- Collaborated with Engineering and Product to improve API usability through guided interactions

### Chargebee Copilot (AI-Assisted Developer Tool)

Chargebee Copilot is an AI-powered assistant that helps developers understand APIs, debug
integration issues, and get contextual guidance without manual documentation lookups.

**What it enables:**
- Natural-language interaction with API knowledge
- Contextual, real-time responses
- Guided troubleshooting and onboarding
- Improved self-service success

**My contribution:**
- Helped shape Copilot prompts and scenarios based on real developer questions
- Ensured API responses were accurate, contextual, and aligned with actual behavior
- Defined common onboarding, error-handling, and integration workflows for AI assistance

## 💻 Code & Tooling I Work With

While I’m not a full-time software engineer, I work hands-on with:

- HTML, CSS, JavaScript (ES6+)
- TypeScript (working knowledge)
- JSON and XML payloads
- Markdown and MDX
- GitHub workflows and CI/CD
- API testing tools (Postman, curl)

I use these regularly to validate examples, test workflows, and build
developer documentation and tooling experiences.
